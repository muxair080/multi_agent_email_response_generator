       "  'content': 'TL;DR: LangGraph is module built on top of LangChain to better enable creation of cyclical graphs, often needed for agent runtimes. This state is updated by nodes in the graph, which return operations to attributes of this state (in the form of a key-value store). After adding nodes, you can then add edges to create the graph. An example of this may be in the basic agent runtime, where we always want the model to be called after we call a tool. graph.add_edge(\"tools\", \"model\") The state of this graph by default contains concepts that should be familiar to you if you\\'ve used LangChain agents: input, chat_history, intermediate_steps (and agent_outcome to represent the most recent agent outcome)',\n",

While LangChain allows you to define chains of computation (Directed Acyclic Graphs or DAGs), LangGraph introduces the ability to add cycles, enabling more complex, agent-like behaviors where you can call an LLM in a loop, asking it what action to take next. Step 1: Define the Graph State First, we define the state structure for our graph. Step 4: Add Nodes to the Graph LangGraph is a versatile tool for building complex, stateful applications with LLMs. By understanding its core concepts and working through simple examples, beginners can start to leverage its power for their projects.',\n",
