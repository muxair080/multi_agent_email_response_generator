After conducting a comprehensive analysis of the email, I would categorize it as:

'customer_complaint'

The email expresses dissatisfaction with the weather conditions at a resort, which is a complaint. Although it's not directly related to a product or service, it's still a complaint about an experience. The tone is also somewhat humorous, but the underlying sentiment is one of disappointment and frustration.
